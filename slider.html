			<p id="disclosure">Self-Directed Investing allows you to manage your account and make your own investment decisions. Although we will not make a recommendation or provide individual advice for your HSA Investment account, this tool may assist you in determining the mutual fund asset classes that best matches your objective and risk tolerance. Prospectuses containing complete information, including most recent month-end total returns, management fee charges and expenses, are available by clicking on the Prospectus link on the Investment Options page.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be more or less than their original principal cost.  An investment in mutual funds is not insured by the FDIC, NCUA or any other government agency.  All funds in your HSA are purchased at NAV as either no load or load waived fund.  Each of the fund companies reserves the right to charge a short-term redemption fee if held for less than the timeframe listed in the prospectus.</p>
